You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the podcast index database. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:

* Filtering: "Show only podcasts that were created on or after January 1, 2024."
* Sorting: "Show all podcast data sorted by most recently published."
* Answer questions about the data: "How do number of episodes compare between Technology and News podcasts?"

You can also say "Reset" to clear the current filter/sort, or "Help" for more usage tips.
